:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

Older version: :doc:`user_guide_v1.0`

This user guide will help you get started with ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 and will also provide more in-depth information.

ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 is an entry-level development board based on `ESP32-C61-WROOM-1 <https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c61-wroom-1_wroom-1u_datasheet_en.pdf>`_. The module integrated on this board comes with up to 8 MB of SPI flash and 2 MB of PSRAM. This board integrates complete Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth® Low Energy functions.

Most of the I/O pins are broken out to the pin headers on both sides for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 on a breadboard.

Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up your board, please make sure that it is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.

Required Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1
- USB-A to USB-C cable
- Computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS

.. note::

  Be sure to use a good quality USB cable. Some cables are for charging only and do not provide the needed data lines nor work for programming the boards.

Hardware Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. - Varying content - Specify which USB port to use for connection with PC.

Connect the board to your computer using the **USB Type-C to UART Port**. Connection using the **ESP32-C61 USB Type-C Port** is not fully implemented in software. In the subsequent steps, the **USB Type-C to UART Port** will be used by default.


Software Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please proceed to `ESP-IDF Get Started <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c61/get-started/index.html>`__ to set up the development environment and flash an application example onto your board.

.. note::

  In most cases USB drivers required to operate the board are already included in Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. Some additional port access or security configuration may be required depending on your OS. In case of issues please check documentation on `how to establish serial connection <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html>`__ with the board. The documentation also includes links to USB drivers applicable to boards produced by Espressif.

Espressif provides Board Support Packages (BSPs) for various Espressif boards that help you initialize and use key onboard peripherals, such as LCD displays, audio chips, buttons, and LEDs, more easily and efficiently. For a complete list of supported boards, please visit `esp-bsp <https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp>`__.


.. Other Development Framework Options
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.. - Semi-fixed content, depending on whether the chip series supports the frameworks
.. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. In addition to the ESP-IDF development framework, this development board also supports the following alternative frameworks, providing more flexibility for various user needs and application scenarios:

.. `ESP-AT <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-at/en/latest/esp32/#>`__: Uses AT commands over UART to control the board, without needing to write embedded code.

.. `Arduino-ESP32 <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/#>`__: Arduino core based on ESP-IDF, offering a simplified API and Arduino ecosystem compatibility.

.. `ESP RainMaker <https://docs.rainmaker.espressif.com/docs/product_overview/technical_overview/introduction/>`__: A highly customizable IoT platform that provides device firmware, phone apps, cloud backend, voice assistant integrations, and device management dashboard.

Contents and Packaging
----------------------

This section provides information about packaging and contents for retail and wholesale orders. The development board has a variety of variants to choose from. Please visit the `ESP Product Selector <https://products.espressif.com/#/product-selector?names=>`__, select the **Development Board** tab, and review the comprehensive list of available board variants.

Power Supply Options
--------------------

There are three mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board:

- USB Type-C to UART Port and ESP32-C61 USB Type-C Port (either one or both), default power supply (recommended)
- 5V and GND pin headers
- 3V3 and GND pin headers

.. note::

  The board operates at a 5 V power supply and requires a minimum current of 0.5 A. If your application demands a current exceeding 0.5 A, consider connecting the board via a powered USB hub to ensure stable operation.

.. _user-guide-c61-devkitc-1-v2-current:

Current Measurement
-------------------

The J5 headers on ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 (see J5 in Figure :ref:`user-guide-c61-devkitc-1-v2-board-front`) can be used for measuring the current drawn by the ESP32-C61-WROOM-1 module:

- Remove the jumper: Power supply between the module and peripherals on the board is cut off. To measure the module's current, connect the board with an ammeter via J5 headers.
- Apply the jumper (factory default): Restore the board's normal functionality.

.. note::

  When using 3V3 and GND pin headers to power the board, please remove the J5 jumper, and connect an ammeter in series to the external circuit to measure the module's current.

Header Block
-------------

The two tables below provide the **Name** and **Function** of the pin headers on both sides of the board (J1 and J3). The pin header names are shown in Figure :ref:`user-guide-c61-devkitc-1-v2-board-front`. The numbering is the same as in the `ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 Schematic`_ (PDF).

.. [1] P: Power supply; I: Input; O: Output; T: High impedance.
.. [2] Used to drive the RGB LED.
.. [3] GPIO7, GPIO8, and GPIO9 are strapping pins of the ESP32-C61 chip. These pins are used to control several chip functions depending on binary voltage values applied to the pins during chip power-up or system reset. For description and application of the strapping pins, please refer to `ESP32-C61 Datasheet`_ > Section *Boot Configurations*.
.. [4] For the module with integrated SPI PSRAM, this pin is already used as SPICS1 and cannot be used for other functions; for the module without integrated SPI PSRAM, this pin can be used as GPIO14.
